Welcome to the **TINY Compiler** project! This is an educational compiler designed to translate source code written in the TINY language into machine-readable format.  

---

#### **Project Overview**  
The **TINY Compiler** project aims to provide a step-by-step demonstration of compiler construction, from scanning source code to generating target code. Each stage of the compiler will be built incrementally to help learners understand the compilation process.  

---

#### **Current Release: Version 1.0.0**  
The first release focuses on the **Scanner** module, which is responsible for:  
- Converting source code into a stream of tokens.  
- Reporting errors for invalid tokens.  
- Providing a user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for code analysis and debugging.  

##### Features  
- Load or input TINY language source code via the GUI.  
- Tokenized output displayed in a structured format.  
- Error messages for unrecognized tokens or invalid syntax.

#### **Future Plans**  
Upcoming versions will include:  
- **Parser** for syntax analysis.  
- **Semantic Analyzer** for type and context validation.  
- **Code Generator** for producing executable output.
